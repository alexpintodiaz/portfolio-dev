    Hello! My name is Alexander Pinto, and I'm a passionate Software Developer.
    I began my journey in software development with frontend technologies,
    diving into the world of <strong>JavaScript</strong>. As I gained
    experience, I transitioned to using <strong>React</strong> with <strong
      >TypeScript</strong
    >, which opened up new possibilities for me.
  </p>

  <br />

  <p>
    Over time, I expanded my skillset to become a <strong
      >full-stack developer</strong
    >, currently utilizing a stack that includes React and TypeScript on the
    frontend, along with <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>FastAPI</strong> on
    the backend. I am well-versed in managing both SQL databases with MySQL and NoSQL
    databases with MongoDB. I graduated from <strong>Misi√≥nTic 2022</strong> and
    I'm currently pursuing a <strong
      >Technology in Software Analysis and Development</strong
    > degree.
  </p>

  <br />

  <p>
    Beyond coding, I'm fascinated by all things related to computing and
    systems. A lifelong gamer since the '90s. In my free time, I enjoy reading
    books and manga, playing sports, and spending quality time with my family
    and friends.
