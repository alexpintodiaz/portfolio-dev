      My name is Alexander Pinto, and I'm a passionate Software
      Developer. I began my journey in software development with frontend
      technologies, diving into the world of <strong>JavaScript</strong>. As I
      gained experience, I transitioned to <strong>React</strong> with <strong
        >TypeScript</strong
      >, which opened up new possibilities for me.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      Over time, I expanded my skillset to become a <strong
        >full-stack developer</strong
      >, currently utilizing a stack that includes React and TypeScript on the
      frontend, along with <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>FastAPI</strong> on
      the backend. I have experience managing both SQL databases, such as MySQL,
      and NoSQL databases like MongoDB. I graduated from <strong
        >Misi√≥nTic 2022</strong
      > and I'm currently pursuing a <strong
        >Technology in Software Analysis and Development</strong
      > degree.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      I have collaborated in agile teams, refining my skills in communication
      and teamwork. I am committed to delivering high-quality solutions that
      meet customer needs and product requirements. My passion for continuous
      learning and problem-solving drives my work.
